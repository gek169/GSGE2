To build the library on a Linux System:
1) Ensure you have the dependencies installed and your system is compatible
2) run Q.sh to Quickly compile the entire engine and all demos.
3) Attempt to run the test programs by doing ./mainX.bin (where X is the number of the demo)


To build the library on a Windows System:
1) Ensure that you have the dependencies installed correctly (MSYS2, Bullet Physics, OpenAL + redist, GLM, GLFW, etc)
	NOTE: As of right now, MSYS2's MinGW-w64 has broken OpenGL headers by default. You'll need to grab an old version.
2) Copy the DLLs associated with all dependencies from msys64/mingw64/bin to THEVERSION folder.(Needed to execute compiled programs outside of Msys2 environment)
3) Open MSYS2's Mingw_W64 terminal
4) Navigate to the THEVERSION directory
5) Run Compiler_Call_MSYS2.sh\
6) Run MainX.exe where X is replaced with the number of the demo you want to run.
