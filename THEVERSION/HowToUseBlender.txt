When you've created your model, just export as OBJ. You can create per-vertex color using the OBJ Colorer utility and a texture.

Please note that Z is up in blender, but Z is up in my game engine. You can set the axes of Blender's OBJ exporter to fix it or...

You can use utils/ObjSwapYZ to swap the Y and Z coordinates of your models (including the normals)

In Edit Mode:
* E for extrude. Recommended you use Faces selection mode in the majority of cases.
	* Right clicking to cancel does NOT cancel the extrude you still have to undo it.
		* Right click cancel just cancels the "move" op that happens AFTER the extrude...
	* can scale the extrusion without positioning to create inset faces
	* Can move the extruded face 
In the right-hand menu:
* Mirror modifiers are really helpful
* with all verts/faces selected hit U and click Smart UV Project to create texture coordinates.

Use the F2 Addon to fill in faces box-illy (Like if you deleted a face of a sub-divided cube, how would you rebuild it? this tool)
Just hit F with corner vert selected.

Making maps:
* Flip normals on cube
	* Limit selection to visible button on the button bar! Prevents you from selecting backfaces.
* Loop cut and slide
* Extrude
* Scale



In all modes:
* Right click to start moving, left click to confirm moving, right click to cancel moving
	* hit X to restrict to X axis, same for Y and Z
		* Hit again to use local coordinates
* R to rotate
	* hit X to restrict to X axis, same for Y and Z
		* Hit again to use local coordinates
* Use the left hand menu to create objects, don't bother with keyboard shortcuts
	* Make sure the 3D cursor is set in the in-3d-view righthand menu.
