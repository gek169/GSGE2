You need to replace the OpenAL SO file with your own version if you want to avoid having an LGPL dependency... if that bothers you.
I don't know what it's called but I'm sure you can find it.

It needs a complete function name table and identical functionality
to OpenAL

You can check out the OpenAL headers to see what the interface you need to produce is, make sure to compile with -fPIC

Documentation of OpenAL's functionality (so you can reproduce it with
your own code) is available on their website:
