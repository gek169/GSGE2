Filename will be ID.gsge
Before anything, we have to write out that the object REQUIRES_EXPORT so that its require export flag will be set upon reload... so that
all its assets get re-exported.
Obviously it'll be independent so it will own everything.

First, write out the collision sound and its settings.
 > We actually store the collision sound filename in the GkObject...
Second, Write out any owned textures.
	* stbi_image_write_png
	* Have a corresponding vector of filenames
	* Write to a directory
	TODO: Have to have a special line type for owned textures.
Third, Write out meshes and their settings
	* Export OBJs
	* list off TEXTURE lines, we can retrieve all information about a texture from the Texture*
		* If a safetexture has no Daddy0 then we consider the rules for exporting "broken" and cancel the export.
			* We could also reference a placeholder texture.
	* list off CUBEMAP lines
		* just get the name
Fourth, write out collision shapes
	* BtConvexHullShapes will export to OBJ as vertex clusters.
		* btVector3* getUnscaledPoints() and getNumPoints()
	* BtBvhTriangleMeshShape has an export method now, so we can export them.
	* Sphere, Cone, and Box are trivial.
write out MeshInstance and RigidBody lines.
write out Constraints.
write out GkEntityComponent export lines.
write out Animations.
